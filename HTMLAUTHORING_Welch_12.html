            <h1 class="title">Barrett Licensed M107A1 Bolt Action Powered Airsoft Sniper Rifle</h1>
            <p>The Model 107 Barrett "Light Fifty" rifle is the next-generation of the original M82. Engineered as the first shoulder fired semi-automatic 50 BMG rifle, the Model 82A1 has been proven in combat in every environment from the snow covered mountains, to the desolate deserts, and everything in between. Its low felt recoil and reliable repower delivers on target with every pull of the trigger. More than just a rifle, the Model 82 is an American icon. With a modernized muzzle break and monopod, the M107A1 weapon system becomes a more formidable long-range anti-material rifle than ever before.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Classic Army M132 HPA Powered Rotating Multi-Barrel Micro Gun</h1>
            <p>It is finally here, the moment we have all been dreaming about and waiting for. Never before done in the history of Airsoft, a fully functional Minigun style heavy weapon for under one thousand dollars.
                New from Classic Army, the M132 Micro Gun brings the pain right out of the box; crush the opposing team with an impressive 38 rounds per second (2280 rounds per minute).
                Powered by an electric motor for its 4 rotating barrels, and HPA / gas for propulsion, this weapons devastating effectiveness will have you grinning ear to ear as you properly demonstrate the noun "Overkill."
                Unlike previous iterations of the Minigun, the M132 is actually viable to be fielded as its smaller size and incredibly light weight (9lbs unloaded) does not encumber its wielder.</p>
